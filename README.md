# Face-Recognition-CNN
This program is used for building a neural network that can identify a unique person's face from a live video. Scripts are included that streamline data processing. Data collection remains painful because there is no work-around from having to take hundreds of selfies.

# Data Collection
Face images of other people were collected from the "Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ)" found at https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset
Images of my face were taken myself using my phone's selfie camera over the course of several days.
